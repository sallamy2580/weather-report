# Description

Using [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) I am retrieving weather data for cities entered in the search bar. Denver is the default city populated. As a user, I want to search for a city and I need to be presented with current weather conditions, temperature, humidity and wind speed. The web app is built on Node to act as a server side API. 

# Installation Requirements

1. Clone repo by entering in the CLI: git clone https://github.com/sallamy2580/weather-report.git
